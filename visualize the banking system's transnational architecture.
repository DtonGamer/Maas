I'll help you create a structured prompt for nano banana (or similar image generation tools) to visualize the banking system's transnational architecture. Since we're dealing with complex, interconnected concepts, I'll break this into modular sections that work independently but also combine into a comprehensive picture.

Let me start with the first foundational piece - what I'll call "The Banking Layers" diagram. This will establish the hierarchical structure that sits above national boundaries.

I've created the first foundational piece - "The Layers Above Nations" - which establishes the hierarchical architecture of global banking. This diagram shows how banking operates in layers above national sovereignty, from the BIS apex down through coordinated central banks, SWIFT messaging, multinational banking organisms, and shadow banking.

This works as a standalone piece but also sets up the framework for additional connected diagrams. Here are the logical follow-up pieces we could create:

**Part 2: "The Petrodollar Circle"** - Visualizing how energy, dollars, and military power create a self-reinforcing loop that transcends borders, showing the flow from oil sales → dollar accumulation → reinvestment in Western banking → more lending → perpetuating the cycle.

**Part 3: "The Currency Markets Veto Power"** - Showing how the $7 trillion/day forex market operates 24/7 across time zones, demonstrating how markets can override government policy through capital flight and currency attacks.

**Part 4: "The MicroStrategy Oxygen Machine"** - Documenting the specific mechanism of how MSTR converts debt and equity dilution into Bitcoin accumulation, showing the premium exploitation cycle and its current breakdown.

**Part 5: "ISO 20022: The Control Grid"** - Visualizing how the new messaging standard creates unprecedented surveillance and control capabilities, showing the technical architecture of the November 2025 cutover.

**Part 6: "CBDCs: Programmable Oxygen"** - Showing how central bank digital currencies represent the next evolution, with embedded rules, instant settlement, and complete transaction visibility.

Each piece would use the same whiteboard aesthetic and can reference the others (like "see Layer 1 diagram for BIS details"), but each also stands alone as its own complete explanation. Which piece would you like me to develop next, or would you prefer modifications to this first one?
