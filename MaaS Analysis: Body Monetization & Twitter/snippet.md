## Production Tips for Maximum Impact:

### Visual Style:
- **Look straight at camera** - eye contact makes them trust you fast
- **Put text on screen** for key numbers (₦1,520, ₦5M, $10K) - make them pop
- **Cut fast** - keep energy high, no boring parts
- **Show your face** - people trust face more than voiceover

### Hook Strategy:
- Start with pain wey go make them think "that's me o"
- Use real numbers (not "you're broke" but "₦80K salary")
- Ask questions wey go expose their current frustration
- Challenge wetin they think ("you think X but actually Y")

### Scratch Pattern:
- Show say you understand the pain ("I get am", "na because...")
- Explain WHY they dey stuck (not wetin they already know)
- Show contrast ("Meanwhile, other people wey solve this...")
- Use real examples and numbers to make am real

### Relief Style:
- Hint at the solution without saying everything
- Use phrases like "there's a specific...", "the exact...", "one simple..."
- Make them curious ("e no be wetin you think")
- Talk about change ("this changed everything for me")

### Tease Formula:
- Clear instruction: "Follow", "Save this", "Come back tomorrow"
- Time pressure: "drops in 24 hours", "tomorrow", "this week"
- Fear of missing out: "don't miss am", "you go wish you know"
- Make am feel scarce: "I go only cover this once"

### Posting Strategy:
- Post 3-5 of these daily at different times
- Each snippet promises NEXT video, so people go come back
- Actually give them wetin you promise (this one build trust = follows)
- Mix topics (payment, psychology, legal, technical) for variety
- Pin your best one to your profile

### Comments Strategy:
- Pin a comment like "Comment 'READY' and I go send you the starter list"
- Gather people wey dey interested for future
- Reply top 10 comments to help algorithm
- Use comments to tease more ("Good question, I dey cover this for Friday video")

### How People Go Pay You:
These snippets → They click your profile → Bio link → Free something → Email list/Telegram → Paid course or one-on-one help

The goal: Make them feel like you see them (itch), you understand them (scratch), there's hope (relief), and they incomplete without the full answer (tease). Every video suppose end with them thinking "I NEED know the rest."
