# TikTok Itch-Scratch-Tease Snippets (15-30 seconds)

## Snippet 1: "The Dollar Realization" (20 seconds)

**ITCH (0-3s):** "You're working harder than everyone you know but still broke. Why?"

**SCRATCH (3-10s):** "Because you're trading naira for your time when you should be collecting dollars. Right now, ₦1,520 to $1. That same content you're posting for free? Somebody abroad would pay $50 for it. That's ₦76,000. For ONE piece of content."

**RELIEF (10-15s):** "The difference between you and creators cashing out? They understood this one thing early..."

**TEASE (15-20s):** "Follow me, I'll break down the whole system tomorrow. It's simpler than you think."

## Snippet 2: "The Instagram Trap" (18 seconds)

**ITCH (0-3s):** "100K followers but your account balance is still crying. Something's not adding up."

**SCRATCH (3-8s):** "That's because Instagram is not a bank. It's a funnel. Those likes and comments? They're worthless unless you're converting them to actual dollars elsewhere."

**RELIEF (8-13s):** "The creators making ₦5M+ monthly from their following figured out where to route their traffic..."

**TEASE (13-18s):** "Next video, I'm showing you exactly where they're sending people. Don't miss it."

---

## Snippet 3: "The Boundary Paradox" (22 seconds)

**ITCH (0-4s):** "You think doing 'everything' will make you the most money. That's exactly why you're earning less."

**SCRATCH (4-12s):** "The girls making $10K monthly (₦15M+) have STRICTER boundaries than you. They say 'no' to more things. They're selective about clients. They protect their energy. And somehow, they charge higher rates and people still pay."

**RELIEF (12-18s):** "There's actual psychology behind why boundaries increase your income, not decrease it..."

**TEASE (18-22s):** "Part 2 drops in 24 hours. This changed everything for me."

---

## Snippet 4: "The Pricing Mistake" (20 seconds)

**ITCH (0-3s):** "You're charging ₦5,000 for content that took you 3 hours to create. Let's do the math on why you're stuck."

**SCRATCH (3-11s):** "₦5,000 is roughly $3.28. You spent 3 hours creating it. That's $1.09 per hour. A Bolt driver in Lagos makes better money. Meanwhile, creators charging $50 (₦76,000) for similar content are making $16.67 per hour. Same work, different pricing strategy."

**RELIEF (11-16s):** "The shift isn't about working harder, it's about pricing in the right currency and targeting the right market..."

**TEASE (16-20s):** "Tomorrow I'm breaking down the exact pricing tiers that work. Follow so you don't miss it."

---

## Snippet 5: "The Payment Block" (18 seconds)

**ITCH (0-3s):** "You finally found international clients but your Nigerian card won't work on their platforms. Frustrating, right?"

**SCRATCH (3-9s):** "This is the number one thing stopping Nigerian creators from cashing out. You can have all the skills and following in the world, but if you can't receive the money, you're stuck. Meanwhile, others have solved this with one simple setup..."

**RELIEF (9-14s):** "There are exactly 3 payment solutions that work for Nigerians right now..."

**TEASE (14-18s):** "Next video, I'm walking through all three. You'll be set up in 20 minutes."

---

## Snippet 6: "The Content Treadmill" (25 seconds)

**ITCH (0-4s):** "You're posting 4 times a day, every day, and you're exhausted. Your engagement is up but your bank account hasn't moved. What's wrong?"

**SCRATCH (4-14s):** "You're on the content treadmill—running hard but going nowhere financially. Because posting more doesn't equal earning more. It equals burnout. Professional creators post the same amount or less than you, but they're making ₦10M+ monthly. The difference? They monetize BEFORE they create, not after."

**RELIEF (14-20s):** "There's a specific content system where you create once and get paid multiple times for the same work..."

**TEASE (20-25s):** "I'll explain the whole system tomorrow. This is what separates hobbyists from professionals."

---

## Snippet 7: "The Face Fear" (20 seconds)

**ITCH (0-3s):** "You want to start but you're scared your family or church members will see your page. So you're stuck doing nothing."

**SCRATCH (3-10s):** "I get it. But here's what you're not seeing—creators are making full-time income with partial face, no face, or geo-blocked content. Your aunty in Enugu will never stumble on your page if you set it up correctly."

**RELIEF (10-16s):** "There are 5 specific privacy strategies that let you operate completely anonymously while still cashing out..."

**TEASE (16-20s):** "Next video covers all 5. Your identity stays protected, your money still flows."

---

## Snippet 8: "The Legal Gray Zone" (22 seconds)

**ITCH (0-4s):** "You've heard about the March 2025 ban and now you're confused about what's legal and what's not. Should you even start?"

**SCRATCH (4-12s):** "Here's what nobody's explaining clearly: The ban targeted explicit adult content, but there's an entire universe of legitimate content that pays just as well—fitness coaching, styling consultations, life coaching, tutorials. All 100% legal, all paying in dollars."

**RELIEF (12-18s):** "The smartest creators pivoted to these categories and many are actually earning MORE now because there's less competition..."

**TEASE (18-22s):** "Tomorrow I'm listing the top 10 profitable legal categories with exact pricing ranges. You don't want to miss this."

---

## Snippet 9: "The Free Content Trap" (18 seconds)

**ITCH (0-3s):** "Your TikTok is popping off. 50K views, 2K likes, hundreds of comments. But somehow you're still broke."

**SCRATCH (3-10s):** "Because you're giving away the full product for free. Those views and likes? They're worth exactly ₦0 unless you're converting them somewhere. You're basically working for TikTok's shareholders, not for yourself."

**RELIEF (10-15s):** "There's a simple funnel that turns those 50K views into actual dollars in your account..."

**TEASE (15-18s):** "Follow me. Tomorrow's video breaks down the exact setup."

---

## Snippet 10: "The Electricity Excuse" (20 seconds)

**ITCH (0-3s):** "You're thinking, 'How can I be a consistent creator when NEPA is this inconsistent?' Valid concern."

**SCRATCH (3-11s):** "But here's the thing—creators making millions monthly in Nigeria deal with the same NEPA you deal with. The difference? They use a production system that works AROUND power issues, not despite them. They create everything in batches when light is available, then schedule for weeks."

**RELIEF (11-16s):** "There's a specific batching schedule that lets you shoot an entire month's content in one 4-hour session..."

**TEASE (16-20s):** "I'll share the exact template tomorrow. NEPA will never be your excuse again."

---

## Snippet 11: "The Platform Confusion" (25 seconds)

**ITCH (0-4s):** "Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, OnlyFans, Patreon, Fansly—you're overwhelmed. Which platforms should you even focus on?"

**SCRATCH (4-14s):** "That confusion is costing you money every single day. Because each platform has a specific job in your money-making system. TikTok is NOT for selling—it's for attracting. Patreon is NOT for going viral—it's for collecting. When you use platforms wrong, you work 10x harder for 1/10th the results."

**RELIEF (14-20s):** "There's a simple 3-platform strategy that covers everything—traffic, conversion, and retention..."

**TEASE (20-25s):** "Next video, I'm mapping out the exact system. Save this so you remember to come back."

---

## Snippet 12: "The Comparison Trap" (22 seconds)

**ITCH (0-4s):** "You see other creators flexing $5K months and you're thinking, 'What do they have that I don't?' It's messing with your head."

**SCRATCH (4-13s):** "Let me tell you what they have that you don't—it's not better looks, better content, or more luck. It's information you haven't accessed yet. They know something about the business model that you're still guessing at. And that information gap is the only thing standing between you and similar numbers."

**RELIEF (13-18s):** "The entire system they're using can be learned in one afternoon..."

**TEASE (18-22s):** "I'm breaking it down piece by piece this week. Follow so you catch every part."

---

## Snippet 13: "The Data Cost Fear" (18 seconds)

**ITCH (0-3s):** "Data costs just doubled in Nigeria. You're thinking this isn't the right time to start posting consistently."

**SCRATCH (3-10s):** "But consider this—every ₦500 you spend on data to build your audience is an investment that could return ₦500,000 monthly in dollar subscriptions. The creators who started despite data costs are now making enough to not even notice data price increases."

**RELIEF (10-15s):** "Plus there are data-efficient strategies that cut your usage by 70% while maintaining the same output..."

**TEASE (15-18s):** "Tomorrow's video covers all of them. You'll wish you knew this sooner."

---

## Snippet 14: "The Starting Point Confusion" (20 seconds)

**ITCH (0-3s):** "You know you should start, but you don't know where to start. So you've been researching for 3 months and still haven't posted anything."

**SCRATCH (3-12s):** "That research phase is actually costing you money. Because while you're still planning, people with less knowledge than you are out there earning. They're learning by doing, adjusting as they go, and cashing out. Meanwhile, you're trying to have everything perfect before you begin."

**RELIEF (12-16s):** "There's a dead-simple Week 1 action plan that gets you from zero to monetized faster than you think..."

**TEASE (16-20s):** "I'll lay out the exact week-by-week roadmap tomorrow. Zero to first dollar in 30 days."

---

## Snippet 15: "The Graduate Salary Reality Check" (25 seconds)

**ITCH (0-4s):** "You went to university for 4-5 years. You're now earning ₦80K-150K monthly if you're even employed. And rent alone is ₦600K annually in Lagos. The math isn't mathing."

**SCRATCH (4-15s):** "Meanwhile, a 22-year-old creator with no degree is making ₦5-10M monthly from her bedroom. Same country, same economy, different strategy. She's not smarter than you—she just understood earlier that the traditional employment path is broken and pivoted to the creator economy where your earning potential isn't capped by Nigerian salary structures."

**RELIEF (15-21s):** "The transition from employee to creator doesn't require quitting your job immediately. There's a side-hustle blueprint that lets you build while you work..."

**TEASE (21-25s):** "Tomorrow I'm sharing the exact blueprint. Same one I used. Follow me."

## Production Tips for Maximum Impact:

### Visual Style:
- **Direct to camera** - eye contact creates intimacy and urgency
- **Text overlay** for key numbers (₦1,520, ₦5M, $10K) - makes them pop
- **Quick cuts** - keep energy high, no dead space
- **Show your face** - builds trust faster than voiceover

### Hook Techniques:
- Start with pain point that makes them think "that's literally me"
- Use specific numbers (not "you're broke" but "₦80K salary")
- Ask questions that expose their current frustration
- Challenge their assumptions ("you think X but actually Y")

### Scratch Pattern:
- Validate the pain ("I get it", "that's because...")
- Explain WHY they're stuck (not what they already know)
- Create contrast ("Meanwhile, others who solved this...")
- Use specific examples and numbers to make it real

### Relief Technique:
- Hint at solution without revealing it
- Use phrases like "there's a specific...", "the exact...", "one simple..."
- Create curiosity gap ("it's not what you think")
- Mention transformation ("changed everything for me")

### Tease Formula:
- Clear CTA: "Follow", "Save this", "Come back tomorrow"
- Time urgency: "drops in 24 hours", "tomorrow", "this week"
- FOMO element: "don't miss it", "you'll wish you knew"
- Implied scarcity: "I'm only covering this once"

### Posting Strategy:
- Post 3-5 of these daily at different times
- Each snippet teases NEXT video, creating return viewership
- Actually deliver on promises (builds trust = follows)
- Mix topics (payment, psychology, legal, technical) for variety
- Pin your best performer to profile

### Comments Strategy:
- Pin a comment like "Comment 'READY' and I'll send you the starter checklist"
- Collect engaged audience for future targeting
- Respond to top 10 comments to boost algorithm
- Use comments to tease even more ("Great question, actually covering this in Friday's video")

### Conversion Path:
These snippets → Profile click → Bio link → Free lead magnet → Email list/Telegram → Paid course or 1-on-1 consulting

The goal: Make them feel seen (itch), understood (scratch), hopeful (relief), and incomplete without the full solution (tease). They should end every video thinking "I NEED to know the rest."
