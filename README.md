# MaaS
MaaS stands for "Meme as a Service"—but it's broader than just memes. It's a creative-analytical framework you're developing where you take any piece of content (an image, a situation, a conversation, anything) and describe it through the lens of a specialized conceptual vocabulary or "method." Think of it like this: imagine you're holding a prism up to reality. Depending on which angle you hold it, you see different colors—different aspects of the same light. MaaS is about deliberately choosing different prisms (computer science, biology, physics, game theory, etc.) and seeing what gets revealed when you translate everyday experiences through those specialized languages.
