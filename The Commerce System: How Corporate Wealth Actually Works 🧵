# The Commerce System: How Corporate Wealth Actually Works 🧵

That take on billionaire wealth vs welfare sounds intuitive, but it misunderstands how corporate valuation actually creates wealth extraction mechanisms. Let me show you what's really happening with the Commerce organ.

1/ "Billionaires built companies, their wealth isn't taken from anyone"—this assumes company valuation exists in a vacuum, disconnected from actual resource flows. But let's trace where corporate wealth actually comes from and you'll see a different architecture.

2/ When we say Jeff Bezos is worth $150 billion, we're talking about his Amazon shares multiplied by stock price. But what IS that stock price? It's not just "what he built." It's a claim on future cash flows extracted from every transaction on the platform.

3/ Every time you buy something on Amazon, a portion flows to Amazon as fees, another portion as logistics charges, another as Prime subscription revenue. Multiply this by billions of transactions. That's not wealth Bezos "created"—it's wealth he positioned himself to extract from.

4/ Here's the mechanism most people miss: Amazon captured 40% of US e-commerce by running at losses for years, subsidized by investor capital, undercutting competitors until they died. That's not "building value"—it's using access to capital to eliminate competition, then extracting rents once you've monopolized the space.

5/ Where did that investor capital come from? Largely from pension funds, mutual funds, and institutional investors managing YOUR retirement savings. So workers' deferred wages financed Amazon's monopolization, and now those same workers pay Amazon's markup on every purchase.

6/ The "valuation" of a company is determined by what investors will pay for shares. But institutional investors—BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street—manage over twenty trillion dollars. They ARE the market. They decide valuations by deciding where to allocate capital.

7/ These asset managers don't invest their own money—they invest money from pension funds, 401(k)s, insurance premiums, and sovereign wealth funds. So "market valuation" is really a small group of fund managers deciding what companies are worth using OTHER PEOPLE'S money.

8/ Now here's where it gets interesting: BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are the largest shareholders in almost every major corporation—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, ExxonMobil, JPMorgan Chase. They own pieces of everything, creating interlocking ownership across the entire economy.

9/ This means competition is partially theater. When Apple and Microsoft "compete," the same institutional investors profit from both. They don't care which wins—they want both to maximize shareholder value, which means maximizing extraction from workers and consumers.

10/ Let's talk about how corporate wealth is actually extracted. A corporation pays workers wages—let's say $50k/year. That worker generates $200k in value through their labor. The $150k difference? That's surplus value extracted by the corporation, justified as "profit."

11/ "But the company took the risk, provided the capital, organized the production!" True. But where did that capital come from originally? Most corporate expansion is debt-financed. Companies borrow from banks to build facilities, buy equipment, acquire competitors.

12/ Those bank loans are created from nothing—banks don't lend out depositors' money, they create new money when they issue loans. So the "capital" that justifies profit extraction was created through the banking system's money-creation mechanism, not from anyone's actual savings.

13/ The company repays loans with interest using revenue from workers' productivity and consumer purchases. So workers create value, corporations extract surplus, banks capture interest, and shareholders receive dividends. At each stage, those at the top extract from those below.

14/ Now let's address the "it's just valuation, not real wealth" argument. When Elon Musk borrows $20 billion against his Tesla shares to buy Twitter, he's converting that "paper wealth" into actual purchasing power without selling shares or paying capital gains taxes.

15/ This is how billionaires access their wealth without it being "taken from anyone." They borrow against their shares at low interest rates (because banks know the collateral is good), spend that borrowed money, and the loans are often refinanced perpetually. They never actually "cash out."

16/ Meanwhile, that borrowed money IS real. It buys real estates, funds political campaigns, purchases media companies. The valuation became actual power to shape society, extracted from the productivity of workers and consumers who made those shares valuable.

17/ Let's trace a specific example: Walmart. The Walton family is worth over $200 billion from Walmart shares. Where does Walmart's profit come from? From paying workers minimum wage (many qualify for food stamps) while charging consumers markups on goods.

18/ Walmart workers receive about $25,000/year on average. Many work full-time but need government assistance—food stamps, Medicaid, housing support—to survive. Who pays for that assistance? Taxpayers. So taxpayers subsidize Walmart's labor costs so the Waltons can extract maximum profit.

19/ The Waltons capture wealth, workers receive poverty wages, and taxpayers cover the gap. Then someone says "welfare is taken from me but billionaire wealth isn't." You're paying twice—once through subsidizing their labor costs, again through markups when you shop there.

20/ "But Walmart provides low prices, that's value!" Walmart drove out local businesses that paid better wages by undercutting prices temporarily, creating a dependency, then raised prices once competition was eliminated. That's not value creation—it's wealth consolidation through market power.

21/ Now scale this across the entire economy. Amazon, Walmart, McDonald's, Dollar General—massive corporations paying wages so low that workers need public assistance. Corporate profits reach records while taxpayers fund survival for corporate employees.

22/ The "lesson in economics" in that tweet ignores how corporate valuation is built on infrastructure you paid for—roads for shipping, educated workers from public schools, internet developed with public funding, legal systems enforcing contracts, police protecting property.

23/ Amazon wouldn't exist without the US Postal Service handling last-mile delivery to unprofitable rural areas. Tech companies wouldn't exist without decades of publicly funded research creating the internet, GPS, touchscreens. Their "wealth creation" rests on socialized foundations.

24/ Let's talk about monopoly power directly. When four companies control 85% of beef processing, they can dictate prices to ranchers and consumers simultaneously. Ranchers get squeezed, consumers pay more, processors capture the spread. That's not "creating value"—it's extraction through market dominance.

25/ When private equity buys hospitals, nursing homes, and apartment buildings, loads them with debt, cuts staff, raises prices, then extracts management fees while the actual businesses struggle—whose wealth is that? It's extracted from patients receiving worse care, residents paying more rent, workers getting lower wages.

26/ The pharmaceutical industry exemplifies this perfectly. Companies buy drugs developed with public research funding, patent them, charge Americans 10x what other countries pay. Insulin costs $5 to manufacture, sells for $300. That markup isn't "wealth they created"—it's rent extracted through monopoly pricing power.

27/ Here's the structure most people never see: corporations are legal fictions that allow wealth extraction while limiting personal liability. You can own a company that pollutes, injures workers, or defrauds customers, and you personally face no consequences—the corporation pays fines from revenue.

28/ This means the wealthy can take profits private when things go well, and socialize losses when things go poorly. 2008 financial crisis? Banks got bailouts totaling trillions. Executives kept bonuses. Homeowners lost everything. The system protects capital, not people.

29/ "But welfare creates dependency!" What do you think corporate subsidies do? Oil companies receive billions in tax breaks while making record profits. Agricultural subsidies mostly go to massive corporate farms. Defense contractors are entirely dependent on government spending.

30/ The difference is optics. When a poor person receives $15,000 in food stamps and Medicaid, it's "welfare dependency." When a corporation receives $15 million in tax breaks, subsidies, and government contracts, it's "job creation" and "economic development."

31/ Let's address the "threat of violence" framing. Yes, taxes are backed by state force. But so is private property. If you try to use "Jeff Bezos's third yacht," armed police will remove you. Property rights are enforced through state violence on behalf of owners.

32/ Corporate wealth accumulation requires constant state violence to maintain. Patent enforcement, contract law, police protecting warehouses and stores, military securing global supply chains, courts enforcing debt collection. Remove state violence and private property dissolves.

33/ So the choice isn't between "voluntary wealth creation" and "coercive taxation." It's between different systems of organizing production and distribution, all backed by state force. The question is who that force serves—concentrated wealth or broadly distributed welfare.

34/ Now let's talk about wage theft specifically. Corporations steal more through wage theft—unpaid overtime, off-the-clock work, misclassification, minimum wage violations—than all property crime combined. Estimates exceed $50 billion annually. That's wealth directly taken from workers.

35/ When Amazon drivers urinate in bottles because they can't take bathroom breaks without missing performance targets, that's extracting productivity by denying basic human dignity. The savings from those extra packages delivered flow directly into Amazon's valuation—and Bezos's wealth.

36/ "But you choose to work there!" Do you though? When corporations have consolidated into oligopolies in most sectors, when they share wage information to avoid competing for workers, when non-compete clauses restrict movement—how much choice exists?

37/ Four companies control 85% of US beef, four control 90% of beer, two control 90% of baby formula. Six companies control 90% of media. This isn't a competitive market where workers and consumers have meaningful choice. It's concentrated power extracting rents.

38/ The COVID pandemic revealed this structure clearly. Essential workers risked their lives for minimum wage while corporations made record profits. Billionaire wealth increased by over $2 trillion. Corporate profits hit all-time highs. Worker wages remained stagnant.

39/ "They took the risk!" Most billionaire wealth comes from inheritance (60% of billionaires inherited significant wealth) or from monopoly positions granted through intellectual property law, regulatory capture, or anti-competitive practices. The "risk" narrative is mythology.

40/ Zuckerberg "built" Facebook in a Harvard dorm, but Harvard exists because of centuries of accumulated knowledge, public infrastructure, legal systems. He built on a foundation created by everyone, then enclosed the digital commons and charges rent for access.

41/ Every tech platform follows this pattern: build on public infrastructure and open protocols, achieve network effects and lock-in, enclose what was open, extract rents. They didn't create value in a vacuum—they privatized collectively created digital infrastructure.

42/ Now here's the connection to banking we discussed earlier: corporate valuation exists because financial markets agree to value it highly. But financial markets are dominated by institutions managing other people's money, making decisions that benefit themselves through fees.

43/ When BlackRock invests your 401(k) in Amazon, they collect management fees whether Amazon helps or hurts you as a worker or consumer. They're incentivized to maximize Amazon's stock price through any means—monopolization, wage suppression, tax avoidance—because that's how they profit.

44/ This is why the Commerce organ and Banking organ are inseparable. Banking provides the capital that lets corporations monopolize. Corporations generate the profits that banking captures through interest and investment returns. Together they extract from workers and consumers.

45/ The corporate structure itself is designed for extraction. Shareholders want maximum return. Management gets compensated through stock options. Both want stock prices high. What raises stock prices? Cutting labor costs, raising prices, avoiding taxes, lobbying for favorable regulations.

46/ None of these activities "create value"—they redistribute value from workers and consumers to shareholders. The corporate form is legally optimized for this extraction, which is why corporate profits as a share of GDP have steadily increased while labor's share steadily decreased.

47/ Since 1975, productivity increased 77% while wages increased only 12%. Where did that gap go? To corporate profits and executive compensation. Workers produced more, got paid relatively less, and shareholders captured the difference. That's not wealth creation—it's wealth transfer.

48/ "But innovation created value!" True innovation does create value. But most corporate wealth comes from market power, not innovation. Microsoft's wealth came from monopolizing operating systems. Google's from monopolizing search. Facebook's from monopolizing social networks.

49/ Once you achieve monopoly, you stop innovating and start extracting. Microsoft fought to kill Netscape, not to build better browsers. Google acquires potential competitors, not to improve services. Facebook copies features from rivals it can't acquire. Monopoly power replaces innovation.

50/ Let's bring this back to the original claim: "Billionaire wealth isn't taken from me." Every time you make a purchase, a portion flows to shareholders as profit. Every time you work, a portion of your productivity is extracted as surplus value. Every time you pay rent to a corporate landlord, you're transferring wealth upward.

51/ That transfer happens through legal mechanisms—property rights, corporate law, intellectual property, contract enforcement. All backed by state violence. It's not "voluntary exchange" when the alternative is homelessness and starvation.

52/ The welfare system is tiny compared to corporate wealth extraction. Total US welfare spending is about $600 billion annually. Corporate profits exceed $2 trillion annually. Stock buybacks alone—pure wealth transfer to shareholders—exceed $800 billion annually.

53/ Who's really extracting from whom? Someone working full-time at Walmart receives $25,000 and maybe $5,000 in public assistance. The Waltons extract billions through ownership while their workers need taxpayer subsidies to survive. Where's the extraction happening?

54/ This is the Commerce organ's function in the Collective System: consolidate market power, suppress wages, raise prices, extract maximum surplus, distribute profits to shareholders, and use those profits to lobby for policies that enable more extraction.

55/ It interfaces with Banking (which provides capital and captures profits), Government (which enforces property rights and provides subsidies), Education (which trains workers), Transportation (which moves goods), Energy (which powers production), and Food systems (which feed workers).

56/ At every interface, commerce extracts value. It pays workers less than their productivity, charges consumers more than production costs, borrows from banking at low rates, receives tax breaks from government, and uses infrastructure built with public funds.

57/ The genius of the system is making this extraction appear voluntary and beneficial. "Job creators!" "Innovators!" "Risk-takers!" These are narratives that obscure the structural mechanism: concentrated ownership of productive assets enables ongoing extraction from those who must work to survive.

58/ When someone says "I hope you enjoyed this lesson in elementary economics," what they mean is "I've accepted the system's self-justifying narrative without examining its actual structural function." Real economic analysis requires tracing where wealth actually flows.

59/ Follow the money: Workers produce value through labor. Corporations extract surplus as profit. Shareholders receive that surplus as dividends or stock appreciation. Banking captures portions through interest and fees. All of this rests on state violence enforcing property rights.

60/ The alternative isn't "government controls everything." It's recognizing that all economic systems are organized through collective decisions backed by force. The question is whether that organization serves broad prosperity or concentrated extraction. Currently, it serves extraction.

61/ When billionaires accumulate wealth equal to the bottom 50% of humanity, that's not because they're 50% more productive or took 50% more risk. It's because they control the legal mechanisms that enable extraction from billions of transactions and billions of hours of labor.

62/ That corporate valuation represents a claim on future extraction. It's permission to continue capturing wealth from every transaction flowing through their platforms, every hour worked by their employees, every purchase made by their customers. Forever.

63/ This is why the Commerce organ is so powerful in the Collective System. It's where humans spend most of their time—working and consuming. It's where most wealth extraction happens. And it's protected by narratives that make extraction appear natural and beneficial.

64/ The "lesson in elementary economics" is actually this: wealth concentration happens through legal and structural mechanisms that enable extraction from workers and consumers. Calling it "voluntary" ignores the coercion inherent in "work or starve" and "pay our price or go without."

65/ Real economic literacy means understanding how corporate valuation is built on monopoly power, how profits are extracted from productivity, how banking amplifies extraction through debt, and how all of this is maintained through state violence on behalf of property owners. /end
